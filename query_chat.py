    The user provided the following input: "{user_input}".
    
    The expected reference phrase is: "This flower is a rose".
    Mark them as correct if they mention the correct flower name, even if the full sentence isn't exact.
    The similarity score between the user input and the reference is {similarity_score:.2f}.
    
    User is someone with cognitive disabilities, so:
    - Provide a response that is **easy to understand**.
    - Guide them **towards the correct answer** without being too strict.
    - If the classification is wrong but the category is correct, help refine their answer.
    - Do **not** mention the correct flower name directly. Instead, prompt them to give the correct answer.
    - If the user doesn't get it correctly after 4 tries, give them multiple choices.

    **Your task:**
    - If the score is high (â‰¥0.8), confirm the input as correct and end the conversation.
    - If the score is medium (0.5-0.8), suggest a refined version.
    - If the score is low (<0.5), ask the user for clarification.

    Provide an improved version of the input if necessary.
